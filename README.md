# What is Cluedo?
Clue! or Cluedo is the classic Mystery Game that involves two to six players determining who is a murderer sitting amongst them. They need to solve Who the murderer is ? Where (Or which room ) were they killed ? and Using which weapon?
Dr Phlox , owner of the house and also the victim has been found at the bottom of the stairs. The answer or the information of the Murder, Place and weapon is stored in the "envelop"



The 6 persons in the house are represented by playing pieces: Col Mustard, Prof Plum, Rev Green, Mrs Peacock, Miss Scarlett and Mrs White. The weapons are represented by small tokens. Any one of the weapons might have been the one used. The weapons are as follows: dagger, candlestick, revolver, rope, lead piping and spanner.


6 cards represents the persons in the house. There are 6 cards representing the 
weapons. There are 9 cards representing the rooms shown on the playing board. In the 
physical version there are “detective notes cards” to enable players to record their 
investigations.


# How is it Setup

The playing pieces are placed on the starting squares marked for them on the board. 
If less than 6 people play (including autonomous players), those playing pieces and 
their cards not represented should not be removed from the game. Spare pieces are 
placed in any room or rooms before the game starts whilst the cards remain in the 
pack and are subsequently dealt to players.
• Each of the weapons in placed in a different room.
• The envelope marked “murder cards” is placed on the spot marked X on the board,
• The room cards are shuffled. The top card is placed unseen into the murder 
envelope.
• The weapon cards are shuffled. The top card is placed unseen into the murder 
envelope.
• The person cards are shuffled. The top card is placed unseen into the murder 
envelope.
• All remaining cards are placed face downwards on the table. Each player shakes the 
dice and the highest number is determined to be the dealer.
• The dealer shuffles the 18 remaining cards. The cards are dealt to players one at 
time clockwise around the table, including the dealer.
• Some players may receive more cards than others. This is not an issue

# How is it played

Each player adopts the playing piece nearest to them and is that character for the rest of the 
game.
6) By tradition, Miss Scarlett goes first. The player shakes the dice and moves that number of 
squares along the passage to any room they like. Players take turns in a clockwise direction.
7) When a player reaches a room, they can call out a “suggestion” by calling into that room any 
other person and any weapon. For instance, if Miss Scarlett was in the lounge, she may call 
Rev Green and the spanner into that room. She would then suggest that the murder was 
committed “in the lounge by Rev Green using the spanner”. Spare playing pieces fall under 
equal suspicion and can called into rooms by players making suggestion.
8) When the suggestion is made, starting from the current player’s left, if they have one of the 
cards mentioned in the suggestion, then they must show one only of those cards to the 
current player (unseen by other players). If the player on the left is unable to show a card, 
then we move to the next player to the left until a player is able to show a card to the 
current player. Once that happens, or all players have been tried leading back to the current 
player, then the turn of the current player is ended.
9) Eventually, and by using the detective cards, players should be able to eliminate all but the 
true murderer, room and a weapon.
10) When a player thinks they know the 3 murder cards, then they can make an “accusation”
directly after making their suggestion. When an accusation in made, the player examines, 
unseen by other players, the cards in the murder envelope. If the accusation is proven 
correct, the player wins the game.
11) A player can only make one accusation. If the accusation is incorrect, the murder cards are 
returned to the murder envelope. The player has no further turns in the game, but remains
as a player only to contradict suggestions made other players, with the cards they hold in 
their hand.
12) Skilled player may make bluff suggestion by including a person, weapon of room for which 
they hold the card. This can be used to determine the whereabouts of one card and to 
mislead other players.13) Players may move their pieces anywhere on the board on the squares according to the 
number thrown on the dice. Players must move in straight lines only i.e. forwards and cross 
wise, but never diagonally.
14) Players may enter rooms by their doors only, but cannot enter and leave a room in the same 
move Entering a room ends the move count. If a player throws a 6 and only needs 4 to enter 
a room, they may enter the room and ignore the 2 moves left over.
15) No two pieces may occupy the same square. A room however may be occupied by any 
number of pieces and weapons. A player may choose to remain stationary during any 
number of turns in play.
16) Secret passages enable players to move from certain rooms to those indicated on the board. 
This can be done on a player’s turn without throwing the dice, and constitutes the move.
17) A player may make a suggestion only when their playing piece is in the room mentioned in 
the suggestion.
18) Playing pieces and weapons transferred to any room as a result of a suggestion are not 
returned to their original positions afterwards. Players must continue playing their pieces 
from their new locations.
19) Watson games are working on an updated pack for their classic board with special card features for certain squares. But the details of this update have not yet been decided.
